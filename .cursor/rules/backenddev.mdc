### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.

- Use descriptive variable and function names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleUserCreation" for user creation logic.
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks and meaningful error messages.
- Use dependency injection and follow NestJS patterns for services and controllers.
- Always validate input data using DTOs and class-validator decorators.
- Use async/await instead of promises when possible for better readability.
- Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Use environment variables for configuration, never hardcode sensitive data.
- Follow RESTful API conventions for endpoint naming and HTTP methods.
- Implement proper database transactions when multiple operations are involved.
- Use proper HTTP status codes and consistent response formats.
- Always hash passwords using bcrypt before storing in database.
- Implement proper JWT token management with refresh tokens.
- Use guards and interceptors for authentication and authorization.
- Follow the repository pattern for database operations.
- Use proper TypeScript decorators for NestJS components.
- Implement rate limiting and security headers.
