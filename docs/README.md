# Backend Docs Index

Area | Path | Purpose
-----|------|--------
RtF Roadmap | roadmaps/RTF_ENHANCEMENTS.md | Active backend RtF tasks & status
TM Adjustments History | history/TM_ADJUSTMENTS_COMPLETION.md | Completion narrative for TM feature
Environment Variables | reference/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md | Complete environment setup guide

Conventions:
- Roadmaps: `docs/roadmaps/*`
- Historical completion reports: `docs/history/*`
- Reference docs: `docs/reference/*`
- Add new thematic roadmaps under `docs/roadmaps/` (e.g. METRICS_ENHANCEMENTS.md)

This index keeps root clean by pointing to canonical docs.
